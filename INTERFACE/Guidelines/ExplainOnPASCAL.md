15. do not forget tiny things, like cows' legs, chairs'...... ( worry about part outside bbox, rarely happened)   

special scenarios    
Transparency: agree
Wheels: agree, do we consider those regions between spokes      
Thin structures: agree, using line tool tip is helpfulï¼Œ try your best to draw.        
Objects on tables etc: agree   

thoughts    
objects overlap (2 situations: when handbag or small bowls on table, are we counting them; two objects all in bbox overlapped, count who?)    
when the status of logo will change, red cross or green tick    
when you click next image, tell user what will happen   
Remember to choose category, if you left blank, color of category word will become red to prompt you.
