# Calling a variable from one function to another function in Python    
actually any programming language can use this way   

    def get_email_address():
    #the code to open up a window that gets the email address
    Email = input
    return Email

    def get_email_username():
    #the code to open up a window that gets email username
    Email_Username = input
    return Email_Username

    #same for the email recipient and email password

    def send_email():
    # variables from the other def's
    email_address = get_email_address()
    email_username = get_email_username()

    #code to send email
    
   
   
# Elements   
id: nextImage(element), i, not solved    
time: seconds, end()
