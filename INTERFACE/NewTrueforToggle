we have a toggle that shows/hides traces. One user forgot he clicked it, tried to draw something and then didn't know why it was not working. My idea: whenever the user starts to draw something, we automatically reset this toggle to show the traces.       

solution 1: set trace flag to true everytime we click next image. No need.      
solution 2: setting the corresponding flag to TRUE when tool.pencil, tool.eraser or tool.line is started      

# Trace     
Every time when you click finish, will hide trace in TraceOnTempCanvas function; then in nextImage function, when user click next image button,
will use TraceOnTempCanvas function again and call back trace.   

# Mask
