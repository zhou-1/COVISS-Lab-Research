# No responce from Next Image   
in this version, new users click "Training" and go through Training-> 6 PASCAL images -> 9 flower images. There is a bug that, when the user reaches the last flower image, the page gets stuck after clicking "Next Image". It should show an alert message, but for some reason it's not going to that part of the code. Probably the "if" clauses with "(i<9)" are wrong.
