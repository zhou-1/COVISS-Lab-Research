# Goal   
We will learn different morphological operations like Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing etc.     
We will see different functions like : cv.erode(), cv.dilate(), cv.morphologyEx() etc.    

# Morphological transformations Theory        
Morphological transformations are some simple operations based on the image shape. It is normally performed on binary images. 
It needs two inputs, one is our original image, second one is called structuring element or kernel which decides the nature of 
operation. Two basic morphological operators are Erosion and Dilation. Then its variant forms like Opening, Closing, 
Gradient etc also comes into play.
