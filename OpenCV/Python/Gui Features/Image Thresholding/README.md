# Goal     
First argument is the source image, which should be a grayscale image. Second argument is the threshold value which is used to classify the pixel values. Third argument is the maxVal which represents the value to be given if pixel value is more than (sometimes less than) the threshold value.    
In this tutorial, you will learn Simple thresholding, Adaptive thresholding, Otsu's thresholding etc.    
You will learn these functions : cv.threshold, cv.adaptiveThreshold etc.
