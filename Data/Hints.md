# Hints  

# DJango  
Django is server-side. It means, say a client goes to url you have a function inside views that renders 
what he sees and returns a response in html.

# Ajax   
AJAX calls are client-side code that does asynchronous requests. That sounds complicated, but it simply means it does a request for you in the background and then handles the response. So when you do an AJAX call for some url, you get the same data you would get as a user going to that place.    
no need to refresh page to get update.
