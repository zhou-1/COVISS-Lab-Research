# Here are 8 lists       
listApA, listApB, listPeach, listPear and corresponding gt lists that contain ground truth.    

Generate a single list that combines the other lists in required batches.   
random list: shuffleList, need file name and length of list    
numpy.random.shuffle       
shuffle once for all ApA, ApB, Peach and Pear lists.        
Create a stack for no-gt list then we can use pop in for loop, or we can use pop directly

list.pop([i])     
Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)     


fixed list: .[]    

combine required information in single file with for loop and if else.
