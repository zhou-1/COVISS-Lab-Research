# Python logging configuration    
loggers      
A logger is the entry point into the logging system. Each logger is a named bucket to which messages can be written for processing.     

Handlers   
The handler is the engine that determines what happens to each message in a logger. It describes a particular logging behavior, such as writing a message to the screen, to a file, or to a network socket.
