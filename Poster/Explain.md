# Django   
Django \cite{django2018} is a free, open source Python framework that follows the Model-View-Template architectural pattern. The \textit{Model} layer allows users to access database information without requiring any knowledge of the intricacies of database rules. The \textit{View} logic layer of Django contains functions that handle the communication between the \textit{Model} and the \textit{Templates}, which correspond to the exhibition layers that defines what is shown to users through the browser.
